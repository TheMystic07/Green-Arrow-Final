# Project Title : GREEN ARROW

Our project is a decentralized single-player game on the Stellar Blockchain. It benefits players, creators, and nature by integrating eco-friendly initiatives. Utilizing Stellar for its lightning-fast transactions and smooth developer experience, the game is built with Rust, ensuring high performance. Players enjoy an engaging gaming experience, while developers find the platform robust and efficient. A portion of in-game transactions supports environmental causes, making this project a win for everyone involved.

# Vision for this statement

Our vision is to create a platform that not only entertains but also contributes to environmental sustainability. By leveraging the Stellar Blockchain's efficiency and Rust's speed, we aim to deliver a seamless gaming experience. This project supports both players and developers, while also dedicating resources to environmental conservation, creating a meaningful impact on both people and nature. 

# Software Development Plan

Smart Contract Development:

    Variables: Player assets, in-game currency balance, environmental fund allocation.
    Functions: Buy assets, sell assets, play game, allocate funds to environmental causes.

Game Logic Implementation:

    Develop the core game mechanics and rules.
    Integrate game progression and rewards system.

Integration with Stellar Blockchain:

    Ensure secure and efficient transaction handling.
    Implement payment gateways for in-game purchases.

Rust Programming:

    Optimize game performance using Rust.
    Ensure low-level system efficiency.

Front-End Development:

    Design user-friendly interface.
    Implement responsive and interactive elements.

# Personal Story Summary

Growing up surrounded by nature, I developed a deep appreciation for the environment. As a game developer, I saw an opportunity to merge my passion for gaming with environmental conservation. By creating a decentralized game on the Stellar Blockchain, I aim to provide entertainment while also supporting eco-friendly initiatives. This project is my way of giving back to both the gaming community and the planet.
